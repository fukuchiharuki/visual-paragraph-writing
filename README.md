One sentence can be written per line.
Consecutive lines are counted as a single paragraph.
You can replace sentences by swapping lines.

Use blank lines to separate paragraphs. 
The first sentence of a paragraph is the topic sentence.
Make sure that the topic sentence represents the entire paragraph.
To move a paragraph, move the entire block separated by blank lines.
